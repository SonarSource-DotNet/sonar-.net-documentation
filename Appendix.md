| [Introduction](./README.md) | [Prerequisites](./Prerequisites.md) | [Installation and Configuration](./Installation and Configuration.md) | [Additional Configurations](Additional Configurations.md) | [**Appendix**](Appendix.md) |

## Appendix
### Analysis Parameters

For a complete lists of Parameters that you use to configure project analysis , please refer to <http://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SONAR/Analysis+Parameters.

**>> NOTE >>** For analysis builds integrated with Team Build, as described in the [Installation and Configuration](./1_Installation and Configuration.md), the **sonar-project.properties** is generated as part of the build. In this case, the analysis configuration is done via the SonarQube portal.

## In Conclusion

During our adventure of setting up SonarQube with an existing deployment of Team Foundation Server, we introduced you to Technical Debt; we gave you the prerequisites and installation configurations, and covered the topologies. We hope we have achieved our goals for the guidance, get you up and running quickly with SonarQube and Team Foundation Server so you can start your analysis of your technical debt and begin your debt reduction strategy.

Sincerely
The Microsoft Visual Studio ALM Rangers
