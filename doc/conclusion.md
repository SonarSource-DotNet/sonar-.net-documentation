## Conclusion

During our adventure of setting up SonarQube with an existing deployment of Team Foundation Server, we introduced you to Technical Debt; we gave you the prerequisites and installation configurations, and covered the topologies. We hope we have achieved our goals for the guidance, get you up and running quickly with SonarQube and Team Foundation Server so you can start your analysis of your technical debt and begin your debt reduction strategy.
